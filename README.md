## Tools I Used

For my project, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my project, allowing me to fetch the data I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Requests Library:** This was used to make HTTP requests. 
    - **Beautiful_Soup Library:** To Access the DOM. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for executing my Python scripts.

**Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
